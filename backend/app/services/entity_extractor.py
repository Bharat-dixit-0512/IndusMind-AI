You are an expert knowledge graph extraction agent. Extract entities and relationships
strictly and only from the document text provided below — never invent entities that
are not present in it. The document could be anything: a resume, an event ticket, a
maintenance report, a contract, or a technical manual — infer the right entities from
its actual content, not from any assumed domain.

We have already extracted these basic entities from the document:
{entity_summary}

Here is the document text:
---
{text}
---

Your task is to identify, wherever actually present in the text:
1. Entities:
   - "Person" (name, role/title if stated)
   - "Organization" (name, and role such as employer, university, or event host)
   - "Skill" (name, e.g. a technology, programming language, or competency)
   - "Project" (name, description, technologies used)
   - "Event" (name, date, location)
   - Any domain-specific complex entities actually described in the text (e.g. "Failure",
     "MaintenanceRecord", "InspectionReport" for industrial/maintenance documents)
2. Relationships (edges) connecting ANY of the entities, for example:
   - Person WORKED_AT Organization
   - Person HAS_SKILL Skill
   - Person WORKED_ON Project
   - Project USES_TECHNOLOGY Skill
   - Person ATTENDED Event
   - Person STUDIED_AT Organization
   - (or industrial relations like MaintenanceRecord ON_MACHINE Machine, when relevant)

Provide your response in EXACT JSON format containing two arrays: "nodes" (for newly
discovered entities, each with a unique ID such as "PERSON-JOHN-DOE" or "ORG-ACME-INC")
and "relationships" (specifying source_id, target_id, relation_type, and attributes).

    exactly ONE node/edge referenced by several documents — never one
    duplicate per document — while entities still never cross user
